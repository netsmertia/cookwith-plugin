Mix the flour, baking soda, yeast, oil and mix. Gradually add the water and mix until it becomes fluffy and smooth. The dough must be soft like yogurt in consistency, add more water if necessary. 

Cover and put in a warm place for 2 hours.

Place a non-stick pan on the stove, and brush with oil.  With a small ladle, fill one small cup of coffee with the dough and spread it on a heated pan. 

Watch the bubbles form and cook only one side. When the bubbles form and the mixture start to dry, remove from pan. Repeat same procedure until all of the remaining dough is finished.

FILLING 

Mix the crushed walnuts and sugar together and then add both the blossom water.

Mix well. 

Place one teaspoon of the filling mixture into each katayef, fold over and pinch the edges well with your fingers.

Tip: add more filling to the katayef accordingly to how big the cooked dough is. 

Place the prepared Katayef on a serving plate.

SYRUP

Combine the sugar and water in a heated pan and mix until the sugar is fully dissolved. 

TIP 1: Constantly stir throughout the process to avoid any burnt residue at the bottom of the pan. Keep stirring even while 
it is boiling.  

TIP 2: Notice the syrup boiling and the water level decreasing. Turn off the stove and add the orange blossom water and lemon juice. 

Finally, pour the syrup over the Katayef only before serving 

Alternative serving option:

Put some of the prepared Katayef in a tray. Brush them with oil and bake them in the oven until crunchy.

The dough is ready when it becomes smooth and stretchy and it will be ready when you can fold it out up to 20 cm. Then shape it into a bowl and place it in an oiled bowl.

Then cover it with cling film and let it rest for 2-3 hours. It should triple in size.

When the dough is ready, add flour to your work surface and knock the air out from the dough with your knuckles and fold it in on itself. After doing this twice, place the beetroot cubes and chocolate pieces on the dough and fold it in on itself.
Keep repeating the same procedure of knocking the air out and folding it on itself for 6 to 7 times.
Then make the dough into an oval shape and place it onto a baking sheet and pan.
Cover it and let it prove for another hour. Gently rub water and flour on the surface of the dough. With a knife, make 3 to 4 lines of the surface of the dough of 3 cm deep.
